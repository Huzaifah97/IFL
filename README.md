IFL, also known as Internet Film Library. As the name suggests, it provides you complete information about movies. We have included three popular film industries which are Hollywood, Bollywood & Lollywood. The user just has to click one button to get the complete information of the selected movie. The details of a movie include: name, duration, release date, rating, poster, leading actors, genre, name of the director, budget & earnings and description. The users will also be able to give their own ratings. There are also two dedicated buttons, one for watching the trailer and the other one to watch the movie online.

The front end of IFL is created on Java while the data of the movies is stored in the database. Firstly, a database is created with a table containing columns matching the text fields where the details of the movie is entered. Then the front end is created on Java where the user enters the data about a movie. Jar files are included in the library which are essential in linking the database to netbeans. An update query/statement is used to update the table in the database each time data is entered. All the text fields where the data is entered, are linked to a save button. When the save button is pressed, it takes all the data from the text fields and sends it to the database and a dialog box pops up containing the message “Entered”. To check the data is updated in the database, the SQL file is executed and the data is stored in the table.
